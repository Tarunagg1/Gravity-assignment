# Project Overview Email

**Subject: Assignment Project - Folder Structure and Execution Guide**

---

Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to provide you with a comprehensive overview of my assignment project, including the folder structure and instructions on how to run each component.

## Project Structure

The assignment is organized into three main sections, each addressing different technical challenges:

```
assignment/
├── question2-dsa/           # Data Structures & Algorithms
├── question3-mongodb/       # MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline
├── question4-react-todo/    # React Todo Application
└── .gitignore              # Git ignore configuration
```

## Detailed Component Overview

### 1. Question 2 - Data Structures & Algorithms (`question2-dsa/`)
**Purpose**: Implementation of the Two Sum algorithm
- **File**: `twoSum.js`
- **Description**: Efficient solution to find two numbers in an array that sum to a target value
- **How to run**:
  ```bash
  cd question2-dsa
  node twoSum.js
  ```

### 2. Question 3 - MongoDB Aggregation (`question3-mongodb/`)
**Purpose**: Advanced MongoDB aggregation pipeline for sales revenue analysis
- **Files**: 
  - `salesAggregation.js` - Main aggregation pipeline
  - `testData.js` - Test data and execution script
  - `package.json` - Dependencies configuration
- **Features**:
  - Groups sales data by store and month
  - Calculates total revenue and average prices
  - Uses MongoDB aggregation stages: $unwind, $addFields, $group, $project, $sort
- **How to run**:
  ```bash
  cd question3-mongodb
  npm install
  node testData.js
  ```

### 3. Question 4 - React Todo Application (`question4-react-todo/`)
**Purpose**: Full-featured React todo application with modern development setup
- **Technology Stack**: React 19, Vite, ESLint
- **Features**:
  - Add, edit, delete, and toggle todos
  - Filter functionality (All, Active, Completed)
  - Responsive design with modern CSS
  - Component-based architecture
- **Key Components**:
  - `TodoApp.jsx` - Main application component
  - `AddTodo.jsx` - Todo creation form
  - `TodoList.jsx` - Todo items display
  - `TodoItem.jsx` - Individual todo item
  - `Filter.jsx` - Filter controls
- **How to run**:
  ```bash
  cd question4-react-todo
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
  Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

## Prerequisites

Before running the projects, ensure you have:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** (for question3-mongodb - can be local or cloud instance)

## Additional Notes

1. **Git Configuration**: The project includes a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that excludes:
   - Node modules and dependency files
   - Build outputs and cache files
   - Environment variables and IDE settings
   - OS-specific files

2. **Development Approach**: Each component demonstrates different aspects of modern web development:
   - Algorithm implementation and optimization
   - Database querying and data aggregation
   - Modern React development with hooks and component composition

3. **Code Quality**: All code follows best practices including:
   - Proper error handling
   - Clear documentation and comments
   - Modular and reusable code structure
   - Modern JavaScript/React patterns

## Testing the Projects

Each project can be tested independently:
- **DSA**: Run the algorithm with different test cases
- **MongoDB**: The test script includes sample data insertion and aggregation execution
- **React**: Interactive web application with full CRUD functionality

Feel free to reach out if you need any clarification or encounter any issues while running the projects.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
